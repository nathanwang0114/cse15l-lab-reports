*Keys Pressed:* `<ctrl-v><left><left><left><left><left><left><left><left><left><left><left><left><left><left><left><backspace><backspace><a><h><p><enter>`

Used `<ctrl-v>` to paste in the login info from week 1 lab. Then, used the left arrow key 15 times to get to the @ part of username, and deleted the two filler 'z' characters. After that, I typed 'a' 'h' and 'p'since those are the letters corresponding to my course username. Finally I pressed enter to login.
