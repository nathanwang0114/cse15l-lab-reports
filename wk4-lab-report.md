I used `<ctrl-v>` to paste in the login info from week 1 lab. Then, I used the left arrow key 15 times to get to the @ part of username, and deleted the two filler 'z' characters. After that, I typed 'a' 'h' and 'p' since those are the letters corresponding to my course specific username. Finally, I pressed enter to login.

**Step 5: Clone your fork of the repository from your Github account**

I first typed in git clone which is the cloning command. Then, I used `<ctrl-v>` to paste in the ssh clone link of my lab7 forked repository from github. Finally, I pressed enter to clone the repository onto ieng6.

**Step 6: Run the tests, demonstrating that they fail**
