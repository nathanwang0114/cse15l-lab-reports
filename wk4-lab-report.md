*Keys Pressed:* `<ctrl-v><left><left><left><left><left><left><left><left><left><left><left><left><left><left><left><backspace><backspace>ahp<enter>`

I used `<ctrl-v>` to paste in the login info from week 1 lab. Then, I used the left arrow key 15 times to get to the @ part of username, and deleted the two filler 'z' characters. After that, I typed 'a' 'h' and 'p' since those are the letters corresponding to my course specific username. Finally, I pressed enter to login.

**Step 5: Clone your fork of the repository from your Github account**
