## 4 Different Ways to Use Grep in the Command Line

grep -r "Lucayans"
written_2/travel_guides/berlitz2/Bahamas-History.txt:Centuries before the arrival of Columbus, a peaceful Amerindian people who called themselves the Luccucairi had settled in the Bahamas. Originally from South America, they had traveled up through the Caribbean islands, surviving by cultivating modest crops and from what they caught from sea and shore. Nothing in the experience of these gentle people could have prepared them for the arrival of the Pinta, the Niña, and the Santa Maria at San Salvador on 12 October 1492. Columbus believed that he had reached the East Indies and mistakenly called these people Indians. We know them today as the Lucayans. Columbus claimed the island and others in the Bahamas for his royal Spanish patrons, but not finding the gold and other riches he was seeking, he stayed for only two weeks before sailing towards Cuba.
written_2/travel_guides/berlitz2/Bahamas-History.txt:The Spaniards never bothered to settle in the Bahamas, but the number of shipwrecks attest that their galleons frequently passed through the archipelago en route to and from the Caribbean, Florida, Bermuda, and their home ports. On Eleuthera the explorers dug a fresh-water well — at a spot now known as “Spanish Wells” — which was used to replenish the supplies of water on their ships before they began the long journey back to Europe with their cargoes of South American gold. As for the Lucayans, within 25 years all of them, perhaps some 30,000 people, were removed from the Bahamas to work — and die — in Spanish gold mines and on farms and pearl fisheries on Hispaniola (Haiti), Cuba, and elsewhere in the Caribbean.

grep -r spaghetti
written_2/non-fiction/OUP/Berk/ch2.txt:“When our parents split up, we moved with our mom from Arkansas to Seattle. Mom worked all week, weekends, and most evenings. She had to get a career going so there’d be money to live on and to send us to college. Sarah hung out with another family in the neighborhood. A couple of times a week, she had dinner and went to church with them. Looking back, I’d say they were her substitute family; she ‘adopted’ them, and they ‘adopted’ her. I was too young to go o on my own that way. When I didn’t have after-school activities, Mom insisted that I come home and do chores and homework. Sometimes I got to go to a friend’s house to play, but many nights I’d open a can of spaghetti and have dinner by myself. I spent hours daydreaming and looking at old pictures of Mom, Dad, Sarah, and me.”
written_2/non-fiction/OUP/Kauffman/ch8.txt:Already this is worth the excited attention I gave it so long ago. For the results show that a network with randomly chosen logic nevertheless behaves with exquisite order. Say, a network of , genes is constructed at random, with the simple limitation that each model gene have K = inputs but that the wiring diagram be chosen at random, and the Boolean function assigned to each gene among the possible Boolean functions of K = inputs is also chosen, once and for all, at random, this spaghetti mess of a network with its tangle of , wires connecting the genes in some mad scramble will straighten itself out.
written_2/travel_guides/berlitz2/Costa-WhereToGo.txt:Inland from Almería lies one of the most un-European landscapes on the European continent. The Sierra de Alhamilla is a desert of barren mountains, rocky ravines, and dry gravel riverbeds; spiky agave plants and prickly pears are the only vegetation. The region’s uncanny resemblance to the American West made it a popular film location for spaghetti westerns, including such classics as A Fistful of Dollars and The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly, which set a young Clint Eastwood on the road to stardom in Hollywood. Near the village of Tabernas is an area known as Mini-Hollywood, where two spaghetti-western film sets have been preserved as tourist attractions, complete with horses, cowboys, and barroom brawls.
