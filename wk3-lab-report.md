## 4 Different Ways to Use Grep in the Command Line

`grep -r`

*citation: [https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Grep](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Grep)*
```
grep -r "Lucayans"
written_2/travel_guides/berlitz2/Bahamas-History.txt:Centuries before the arrival of Columbus, a peaceful Amerindian people who called themselves the Luccucairi had settled in the Bahamas. Originally from South America, they had traveled up through the Caribbean islands, surviving by cultivating modest crops and from what they caught from sea and shore. Nothing in the experience of these gentle people could have prepared them for the arrival of the Pinta, the Niña, and the Santa Maria at San Salvador on 12 October 1492. Columbus believed that he had reached the East Indies and mistakenly called these people Indians. We know them today as the Lucayans. Columbus claimed the island and others in the Bahamas for his royal Spanish patrons, but not finding the gold and other riches he was seeking, he stayed for only two weeks before sailing towards Cuba.
written_2/travel_guides/berlitz2/Bahamas-History.txt:The Spaniards never bothered to settle in the Bahamas, but the number of shipwrecks attest that their galleons frequently passed through the archipelago en route to and from the Caribbean, Florida, Bermuda, and their home ports. On Eleuthera the explorers dug a fresh-water well — at a spot now known as “Spanish Wells” — which was used to replenish the supplies of water on their ships before they began the long journey back to Europe with their cargoes of South American gold. As for the Lucayans, within 25 years all of them, perhaps some 30,000 people, were removed from the Bahamas to work — and die — in Spanish gold mines and on farms and pearl fisheries on Hispaniola (Haiti), Cuba, and elsewhere in the Caribbean.

The `grep -r` command is a command that searches through all directories and subdirectories recursively starting from given directory, but in cases where a directory is not specified like this case, it will start with the current directory. It does the same thing as the normal grep command, printing out where it finds a given keyword but you can search all directories at once, allowing you to find a word without any prior information about where the keyword is located.
```
grep -r "Athens" written_2/non-fiction 
written_2/non-fiction/OUP/Rybczynski/ch3.txt:The inconstancy of the International Style practitioners should have been expected. The history of Western architecture is of architects searching for rules, only to bend and break them. Even Classicism, which appears at first glance to be highly regimented, is not immune. As far as we know, the ancient Greeks used only three orders: Doric, Ionic, and Corinthian. Vitruvius describes them, and also refers to a Tuscan order, which is a Roman invention. Roman, too, is the so-called Composite order, an ornate blend of Ionic and Corinthian. The vault, the arch, and the dome, unknown to the Greeks, were other Roman additions to the Classic canon. Architects have been stretching Classical rules ever since: breaking pediments, flattening pilasters, magnifying and shrinking columns, rusticating masonry. A sixteenth-century French architect, Philibert de l’Orme, invented a French order; Edwin Lutyens devised an order based on Mughal precedents for the Viceroy’s House in New Delhi; more recently, Allan Greenberg created an order for the offices of the Secretary of State that incorporated the Great Seal of the United States. Michael Graves designed Classical caryatids (columns carved in the shape of human figures) to support the pedimented front of an office building for the Walt Disney Company in Burbank. While the supports of the porch of the Erechtheon in Athens take the form of graceful maidens, Graves’ caryatids are the Seven Dwarfs.
written_2/non-fiction/OUP/Rybczynski/ch3.txt:Inigo Jones consciously based his work on the architecture of Palladio, but he did not think of himself as working in the Palladian “style,” any more than Palladio would have referred to the Classical “style.” Although Renaissance architects described their architecture as all’antica—in the antique manner—they took it for granted that the history of architecture was a progression: the Romans improved on the Greeks, and they would improved on the Romans. According to the architecture historian Peter Collins, the use of the word style to designate the architecture of a particular period or country is relatively late. He cites James Stuart and Nicholas Revett’s Antiquities of Athens, published in 1762 and credited with inaugurating the Classical Revival in England. The authors, both architects, referred to “the Grecian and Roman style of building.”6
written_2/non-fiction/OUP/Rybczynski/ch3.txt:Early in his career, after emigrating to the United States from South Africa, Greenberg was employed writing design standards for courthouses, which led to an unusual commission: the conversion of an empty supermarket into a courthouse. He gave the commercial building in Manchester, Connecticut, a new façade dominated by a large arch, over-scaled voussoirs, and a pediment. Inside, the barrel-vaulted ceiling of the lobby was supported by a Tuscan order. Greenberg had graduated from Yale in 1965, and like many of his contemporaries was experimenting with the new freedom offered by Postmodernism. However, unlike Venturi and Moore, Greenberg was not coyly introducing Classical elements into a Modernist building; he was returning to Classical roots. From this modest beginning, over the next two decades, came a variety of commissions: a suite of rooms for the Secretary of State in the United States Department of State building, several college and university buildings, and a Roman Catholic church. His commercial work included a newspaper office building in Athens, Georgia, a new entrance for Bergdorf Goodman on Fifth Avenue in Manhattan, and a flagship store for Tommy Hilfiger in Beverly Hills. Greenberg is also known for large country houses, both in the United States and in Europe. Like Lutyens and John Russell Pope, he ventures stylistically farther afield in his residential work—using Georgian and American Colonial styles. One of his early houses was inspired by Mount Vernon, another by Palladio’s unfinished Villa Thiene. Several are picturesque rambling affairs whose relaxed informality recalls the best work of McKim, Mead & White.

The `grep -r` command is a command that searches through all directories and subdirectories recursively starting from given directory, and the given directory this time is the non fiction subdirectory. You can see here that the command only searches recrusively starting from non fiction not printing out any results from travel guides, and this is useful as you don't have to know exactly the amount of sub directories until you find the keyword like with regular grep and can search through all directories in one command. 

`grep -l`

*citation: [https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/grep-command-in-unixlinux/](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/grep-command-in-unixlinux/)*
```
grep -l "Lucayans" */*/*/*
grep: written_2/non-fiction/OUP/Abernathy: Is a directory

written_2/travel_guides/berlitz2/Bahamas-History.txt
```
The `grep -l` command is a command that searches for a keyword in a text file given a directory, and only returns the file name with its respective path of the text file with the given keyword. This is useful when you only want to know which file and its path has a given keyword. 
```
grep -rl "spaghetti"    
written_2/non-fiction/OUP/Berk/ch2.txt
written_2/non-fiction/OUP/Kauffman/ch8.txt
written_2/travel_guides/berlitz2/Costa-WhereToGo.txt
```
The `grep -rl` command is a combination of both the current `-l` command and the previous `-r` command. The command does the same thing as `-l`, but does it while recursively searching through all the directories and subdirectories using `-r`, which is useful when you do not have a clue about which directory a keyword is in. 

`grep -w`

*citation: [https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/grep-command-in-unixlinux/](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/grep-command-in-unixlinux/)*
```
grep -w "Lucayan" */*/*/*

written_2/travel_guides/berlitz2/Bahamas-WhereToGo.txt:Lucaya is set on a fine sandy beach and the expansive Port Lucaya marina gives the whole resort a very nautical feel. A number of large hotels line the Lucayan Beach, their massive façades softened by the hundreds of masts of the yachts moored on the inlet. As of late 1999, the casinos and many of the hotels were being given a facelift and three of the larger hotels on the waterfront were being reconfigured into a single complex.
written_2/travel_guides/berlitz2/Bahamas-WhereToGo.txt:Just north of the Marina is the Lucayan Golf and Country Club, which has some of the best-groomed greens in the Bahamas and a very good restaurant for those who want to watch rather than play — diners enjoy panoramic views over the driving range and several holes.
written_2/travel_guides/berlitz2/Bahamas-WhereToGo.txt:After traveling approximately 10 miles on the main road you’ll come to Lucaya National Park (there’s a small parking lot on your left). The 40-acre (16-hectare) park sits on both sides of the main road and protects a range of Bahamian ecosystems. Inland, trails lead to one of the largest surveyed cave systems in the world, much of which lies underwater. Ben’s Cave, also known as Bats Cave for reasons that will be obvious when you enter, is the most accessible and in fact rather small. It links to the larger caves through subterranean tunnels. The pool in the bottom has layers of fresh water lying on top of salt water. Remains of several Lucayan Indians that were found at the cave entrance are now being studied in Nassau. The caves are also home to a rare species of crustacean, spelonectes Lucayensis, which is said to resemble a swimming centipede. Ben’s Cave is closed during June and July to protect the bats during the breeding season.
written_2/travel_guides/berlitz2/Bahamas-WhereToGo.txt:Heading west from Freeport-Lucaya, you’ll first travel past the cruise port and container port. Across from the entrance to the cruise port is Pier One Restaurant, where you can enjoy wonderful food and feed the sharks that gather underneath the terraces in the evening. Farther west, at Deadman’s Reef, are the remains of an ancient Lucayan settlement discovered in 1996.
written_2/travel_guides/berlitz2/Bahamas-WhereToGo.txt:Modern Bahamian history began on this island in 1648 when the Eleutherian Adventurers, led by William Sayle, arrived from Britain and Bermuda and founded their shaky colony. They landed near the site of Governor’s Harbour on the middle of the island, but after a period of feuding Sayle and some of his followers moved north to Harbour Island and Spanish Wells. Their descendants still live there today. Although they named the island Eleuthera, you may find that the local people call the island Cigatoo, its old Lucayan name.
written_2/travel_guides/berlitz2/Bahamas-WhereToGo.txt:The name Exuma is said to be a derivation of the two Lucayan Indian words that had been used for this group of islands, yumey and suma. The largest Exuma Cays were settled by British Loyalists following the American Revolution. Chief among these was Dennis Rolle, who brought over 100 slaves with him to start a cotton plantation. This venture began to fail after only a few years but Dennis passed the land onto his son John. In 1834 slavery was abolished and John Rolle freed his slaves and deeded the Rolle land on to them “in commonage” at his death. This allowed only those directly related to the Rolle slaves to farm or build on the inherited land. Today most of the native inhabitants of the Exumas bear the family name Rolle.
written_2/travel_guides/berlitz2/Bahamas-WhereToGo.txt:The Spaniards wiped out the population of Lucayan Indians who lived here, and the island remained unpopulated for over 200 years, until it was settled by a number of Loyalist families from the American colonies. They attempted to grow cotton in the thin layer of soil but were unsuccessful, and at the announcement of emancipation they abandoned the island, leaving their slaves behind.
written_2/travel_guides/berlitz2/Bahamas-WhereToGo.txt:Traveling south from Stella Maris you’ll pass uninhabited mangrove swamps on the way to the small town of Simms, an unhurried old settlement known for its distinctive straw-work, which craftswomen are delighted to show visitors. At Deadman’s Cay you’ll find an extensive cave system with faded Lucayan rock drawings. After passing small pineapple and banana plantations, you’ll reach attractive Clarence Town, with its two large churches — one Anglican, the other Roman Catholic — built by Cat Island hermit architect Father Jerome. The blue hole at nearby Turtle Cove, a half-mile walk from the road over rough terrain, provides a memorable diving experience, though it’s interesting even from the rim. The hole is about 80 yards (73 m) across and at least 600 ft (183 m) deep; you’ll sometimes see large turtles and tarpon in the waters.
```
The `grep -w` command is the same as the regular `grep` command except it looks for the exact match for the keyword. This is useful when there could be words that have your keyword inside of them, but aren't your keyword exactly like the given example above "Lucayan" using `grep -w` does not consider the word "Lucayans" as a match where as regular `grep` would. 
```
grep -wl "Lucayan" */*/*/*

written_2/travel_guides/berlitz2/Bahamas-WhereToGo.txt
```
The `grep -wl` command is a combination of both the current -w command and the previous `-l` command. The command does the same thing as `-w`, but using the `-l` command so there isn't a clutter of words on your terminal showing where the keyword is in a text, instead only showing you the path that gets you to the exact given keyword.

`grep -i`

*citation: [https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/grep-command-in-unixlinux/](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/grep-command-in-unixlinux/)*
```
grep -i "lucayans" */*/*/*

The `grep -i` command is the same as the regular `grep` command except it is not case sensitive meaning it doesn't check for capitalization. This is useful if you do not know the keyword's capitalization, but it will get you the results of words that are spelled the same but might not have the same capitalization.

written_2/travel_guides/berlitz2/PuertoRico-WhatToDo.txt:Naïve Amerindian images. Stone carvings of bats, turtles, and monkeys transformed onto T-shirts or wall prints.
written_2/travel_guides/berlitz2/PuertoRico-WhereToGo.txt:To the left is Cuartel de Ballajá (Ballajá Barracks), once the major army barracks under Spanish rule and now a significant cultural attraction. The second floor of the building houses the Museum of the Americas. The museum’s mission is to gather collections of artifacts of Amerindian culture, including folk art, basket-ware from Colombia, and ceremonial masks and costumes from around Central America. 
written_2/travel_guides/berlitz2/PuertoRico-WhereToGo.txt:Follow Calle Beneficencia, the street leading off the right side of the barracks, back towards town. You’ll soon come to a small square on your left with a huge totemic sculpture. This is Plaza del Quinto Centenario (Quincentenary Square). The sculpture symbolizes the 500 years of Puerto Rico’s existence. On close inspection, Amerindian and Spanish themes can be seen, but some elements are a little obscure.
written_2/travel_guides/berlitz2/PuertoRico-WhereToGo.txt:Vieques (pronounced be-ay-kase) is the largest of the two, though its name, from the Amerindian, means “small island.” It’s about 11⁄2 hours by ferry from the coast, or a 30-minute flight from Isla Grande Airport in San Juan. An island of wonderful sandy beaches and farmland, it is also home to a large US military reserve. Regular military flights may mar the tranquillity somewhat, but they can’t spoil the natural beauty. Much of the land has been leased back to farmers, and visitors can enjoy the wonderful beaches, although you’ll need some form of photo ID to gain access to them. On the south coast you’ll find Sun Bay and 3 miles (5 km) of fine government-run public beach (which was used as the location for the film Lord of the Flies). Nearby is Mosquito Bay, an appropriate name, since most of the island seems to have squadrons of the tiny winged beasts. This is a phosphorescent bay, and you can take a boat trip out into the water to agitate the microscopic organisms that give off the strange glow. It’s a fascinating experience. The show is always better on a moonless night.
written_2/travel_guides/berlitz2/PuertoRico-WhereToGo.txt:Another noteworthy museum on Calle Isabel is in Casa Serrallés: the Museum of Puerto Rican Music traces the complicated development of the island’s distinctive musical legacy, from Amerindian influences to the blending of Spanish colonial musical styles.
written_2/travel_guides/berlitz2/PuertoRico-WhereToGo.txt:North of Ponce are attractions of a different kind. Take Route 503 out of town — this road runs along the banks of the Río Portuguéz — and after about a mile and a half (2 km) you’ll arrive at the Tibes Indian Ceremonial Park, one of the most important Amerindian archaeological sites in the Caribbean. The ceremonial site and cemetery are across the river, and you may not enter without a guide. A small museum explains the known history of the Amerindian races; it has a number of cabinets holding artifacts, as well as a skeleton, still in the traditional fetal burial position. Once you’re into the park, the ceremonial grounds come into view. Open spaces discovered since the 1960s are now believed to be used for “ball games,” which had an important though as yet only poorly understood ceremonial purpose in Indian culture.
written_2/travel_guides/berlitz2/PuertoRico-WhereToGo.txt:From Lares take Route 111 to reach the most important Amerindian site on Puerto Rico, the Parque Ceremonial Indígena Caguana (Caguana Indian Ceremonial Park). The park is set in a wide valley surrounded by limestone peaks, one of which is said to represent the supreme god of the Taínos. The several ceremonial ball courts discovered and excavated here suggest the site was one of the Indians’ major centers of worship. The Taínos were still living happily on the island when Columbus arrived in 1493; archaeological finds here date back to 1200 b.c. The ball courts, edged with stones — some with symbols carved on them — are set in fine gardens planted with many native tree species. A small museum displays pottery and other artifacts found at the site.
```
The `grep -ri` command is a combination of both the current `-i` command and the first diffrent grep command we looked at, `-r`. The command does the same thing as `-i`, but using `-r` searches recursively through every directory starting from the given directory, and you can see here that it does not care about the capitalization for "aMerindian", showing results for "Amerindian" and "Amerindians" (if we added `-w` to the command "Amerindians would not be an option).
